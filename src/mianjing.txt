1.Partition integer array respect to zero, i.e. negative ... 0 ... positive, keep relative order
E.g. -1 1 3 -2 2 => -1 -2 1 3 2.

2. Search in 2D matrix,
Given each row and column sorted, or given for each (i,j) A[i][j] < A[i][j+1] & A[i][j] < A[i+1][j]

3. Longest consecutive subsequence in array may contain duplicates.
E.g. A = [1,6,10,4,7,9,5]] => 4,5,6,7

4. Majority element of array. Or find element with frequency larger than n/3.

5. Given an array of integers. Find two disjoint contiguous sub-arrays such that the absolute
difference between the sums of two sub-array is maximum. The sub-arrays should not overlap.
E.g. A = [2 -1 -2 1 -4 2 8],  A1 = [-1 -2 1 -4], A2 = [2 8], difference of sum = 10-(-6) = 16

6. Integer represented by array or linked list, implement plus one.

E.g., T = xyz, S = afdgzyxksldfm, return true.

8. Given an integer array, sort the integer array such that the concatenated integer of the result array is max. e.g. [4, 94, 9, 14, 1] will be sorted to [9,94,4,14,1] where the result integer is 9944141

9. Josephus Problem
See Wiki
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus_problem

10. In a language, there are only 4 characters ‘h’, ‘i’,’r’, ‘e’. and we have to write a function which takes a string as input and returns whether the given input string is a “valid word” or not.
Definition of valid word :
1. A given word is a valid word if it is of the form h^n i^n r^n e^n where n >=1. (eg: hhiirree)
2. Valid words has concatenation property i.e. if w1 and w2 are valid words w1w2 is also a valid word.

11. The first missing positive integer in array

12. Given a string (for example: "a?bc?def?g"), write a program to generate all the possible strings by replacing ? with 0 and 1.Example:
Input : a?b?c?
Output: a0b0c0, a0b0c1, a0b1c0, a0b1c1, a1b0c0, a1b0c1, a1b1c0, a1b1c1

13. You have k lists of sorted integers. Find the smallest range that includes at least one number from each of the k lists.

List 2: [0, 9, 12, 20]
List 3: [5, 18, 22, 30]
The smallest range here would be [20, 24] as it contains 24 from list 1, 20 from list 2, and 22 from list 3.

23. Variation of Majority Element
Given a sorted array of integers, write a function that will return the number with the biggest number of repetitions.
(Asked to refine the solution to be more efficient)

Partition a set of numbers into two such that difference between their sum is minimum, and both sets have equal number of elements.
For example: {1, 4, 9, 16} is partitioned as {1,16} and {4,9} with diff = 17-13=4.
Does greedy work here? First sorting, and then picking smallest and largest to fall in set 1, and picking 2nd smallest and 2nd largest to fall in set 2.

24. String getSentence(String text, Set<String> dictionary);
// text is a string without spaces, you need to insert spaces into text, so each word seperated by the space in the resulting string exists in the dictionary, return the resulting string
// running time has to be at least as good as O(n)
// getSentence("iamastudentfromwaterloo", {"from, "waterloo", "hi", "am", "yes", "i", "a", "student"}) -> "i am a student from waterloo"

25. Given an array having positive integers, find a continous subarray which adds to a given number.

26. Determine minimum sequence of adjacent values in the input parameter array that is greater than input parameter sum.

eat
bxy
e is ranked above b according to the dictionary.

Given a array of integers , find 3 indexes i,j,k such that, i<j<k and a[i] < a[j] < a[k]. Best possible is a O(n) algorithm.

28. Write a program to determine whether n/2 distintinctve pairs can be formed from given n integers where n is even and each pair's sum is divisible by given k. Numbers cannot be repeated in the pairs, that means only you can form total n/2 pairs.





29. You are given a dictionary, in the form of a file that contains one word per line. E.g.,
abacus
deltoid
gaff
giraffe
microphone
reef
qar
You are also given a collection of letters. E.g., {a, e, f, f, g, i, r, q}.
The task is to find the longest word in the dictionary that can be spelled with the collection of
letters. For example, the correct answer for the example values above is “giraffe”. (Note that
“reef” is not a possible answer, because the set of letters contains only one “e”.

33. You are given an array of n elements [1,2,....n]. For example {3,2,1,6,7,4,5}.
Now we create a signature of this array by comparing every consecutive pir of elements. If they increase, write I else write D. For example for the above array, the signature would be "DDIIDI". The signature thus has a length of N-1. Now the question is given a signature, compute the lexicographically smallest permutation of [1,2,....n]. Write the below function in language of your choice.
vector* FindPermute(const string& signature);

34. An array of size n+1 has integers only from 1 to n. The integers 1 to n can be present 0 or more times in the array. Find the first repeating element in the array.

36. http://www.careercup.com/question?id=6227714491023360
Suppose a string is consists of a, b, and c
Now given a integer N, output the amount of all possible strings of length N that don't of have consecutive a,b,c.
e.g. given N=5, string bacca is invalid since the first 3 letters have consecutive a,b,c. and bbbbb is valid.

37. Given a BST and a value x. Find two nodes in the tree whose sum is equal x. Additional space: O(height of the tree). It is not allowed to modify the tree

complexity O(n) time maxm alloted space will be O(height of bigger tree)

39. Given a large network of computers, each keeping log files of visited urls, find the top ten of the most visited urls.
(i.e. have many large <string (url) -> int (visits)> maps, calculate implicitly <string (url) -> int (sum of visits among all distributed maps), and get the top ten in the combined map)
The result list must be exact, and the maps are too large to transmit over the network (especially sending all of them to a central server or using MapReduce directly, is not allowed)

44. http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/an-in-place-algorithm-for-string-transformation/
You are given a string which has numbers and letters. Numbers occupy all odd positions and letters even positions. You need to transform this string such that all letters move to front of array, and all numbers at the end.
The relative order of the letters and numbers needs to be preserved
I need to do this in O(n) time and O(1) space.
eg: a1b2c3d4 -> abcd1234 , x3y4z6 -> xyz346

45. Given a string.Find the longest substring in it such that the substring contains only 2 unique characters.Ex- aabbcbbbadef Ans-bbcbbb

46. Given a polygon with N vertexes and N edges. There is an int number(could be negative) on every vertex and an operation in set(*,+) on every edge. Every time, we remove an edge E from the polygon, merge the two vertexes linked by the edge(V1,V2) to a new vertex with value: V1 op(E) V2. The last case would be two vertexes with two edges, the result is the bigger one.  Return the max result value can be gotten from a given polygon.

47. Write the code to find lexicographic minimum in a circular array, e.g. for the array
BCABDADAB, the lexicographic mininum is ABBCABDAD

48. Write an algorithm to find out how many different summations you can compute using numbers range from 1 to 1000. 2 constrains
1) Each valid sum must be less than 1000
2) A number can only be used once for a sum
example:
1+2+300 < 1000 is valid
1+2+300+400 < 1000 is valid
1+2+2 is not valid (2 appear twice)

49. Two heaps, or Buck sort
Write a function that gets a billion integers. How can you find the midian in most efficient way (time)?
same question, but the input is an endless stream of integers, and we want to find the current median.

50. Find next higher number with same digits.
Example 1 : if num = 25468, o/p = 25486
Example 2 : if num = 21765, o/p = 25167
Example 3 : If num = 54321, o/p = 54321 (cause it's not possible to gen a higher num than tiz with given digits ).

51. Imagine you have a sequence of the form 0123456789101112131415... where each digit is in a position, for example the digit in the position 5 is 5, in the position 13 is 1, in the position 19 is 4, etc.
Write a function that given a position returns the digit in that position.
(You could think that this sequence is an array where each cell only holds one digit so given an index return what digit is in that index, however you cannot really create an array since the sequence is infinite, you need a way to based on the index calculate the digit that goes there).
The function has to return a single digit.
Other examples:
index = 100, result = 5
index = 30, result = 2
index = 31, result = 0
index = 1000, result = 3

52. DP seems not working, since the sub-problems are not independent 
http://www.careercup.com/question?id=5231103736545280
There are n bombs in a big circle,and each bomb has a value and a 'effect range'.If you detonated a bomb,you will get this bomb's value,but a bomb can have effect on the neighbors which the distance(difference between index) between them is smaller than the 'effect range'.It's say that the neighbor bomb will be destoryed and you could not get their values. You will given each bomb's value and the 'effect range',and you need calculate the max value you can get.
eg. n=3 index 0's bomb' v is 2,range is 0(will not effect others).and v[1]=1,r[1]=1,v[2]=3,r[2]=1;
this case's max value is 5.(detonate the 0's and than the 2's).

      54. BFS from each node of the whole graph, classify and mark the membership of each person. Meanwhile, count the number of person in each party, and find the majority party with its marker. This can be done in O(n). Given a person, just check if it belong to the majority party. 
      You are at a political convention with n delegates, each one a member of exactly one political party. It is impossible to tell which political party any delegate belongs to; in particular, you will be summarily ejected from the convention if you ask. However, you can determine whether any two delegates belong to the same party or not by introducing them to each other—members of the same party always greet each other with smiles and friendly handshakes; members of different parties always greet each other with angry stares and insults. (a) Suppose a majority (more than half) of the delegates are from the same political party. Describe an efficient algorithm that identifies a member (anymember) of the majority party.

      55. Given a 2-D matrix represents the room, obstacle and guard like the following (0 is room, B->obstacle, G-> Guard):
      0 0 0
      B G G
      B 0 0
      calculate the steps from a room to nearest Guard and set the matrix, like this
      2 1 1
      B G G
      B 1 1
      Write the algorithm, with optimal solution

      56. Find the longest sequence of prefix shared by all the words in a string.
      "abcdef abcdxxx abcdabcdef abcyy" => "abc"

      57. there was a party.there was a log register in which entry and exit time of all the guests was logged.you have to tell the time at which there was maximum guest in the party.
      input will be the entry and exit time of all the n guests [1,4] [2,5] [9,12] [5,9] [5,12]
      the output will be t=5 as there was maximum 3 guest were there namly guest(starting from 1) 2,4 and 5

      59. we will name a number "aggregated number" if this number has the following attribute:
      just like the Fibonacci numbers
      1,1,2,3,5,8,13.....
      the digits in the number can divided into several parts, and the later part is the sum of the former parts.
      like 112358, because 1+1=2, 1+2=3, 2+3=5, 3+5=8
      122436, because 12+24=36
      1299111210, because 12+99=111, 99+111=210
      112112224, because 112+112=224
      so can you provide a function to check whether this number is aggregated number or not?

      60. Brute force, seems Knapsack problem that cannot be solved in P
      There are at most eight servers in a data center. Each server has got a capacity/memory limit. There can be at most 8 tasks that need to be scheduled on those servers. Each task requires certain capacity/memory to run, and each server can handle multiple tasks as long as the capacity limit is not hit. Write a program to see if all of the given tasks can be scheduled or not on the servers?
      Ex:
      Servers capacity limits: 8, 16, 8, 32
      Tasks capacity needs: 18, 4, 8, 4, 6, 6, 8, 8
      For this example, the program should say 'true'.
      Ex2:
      Server capacity limits: 1, 3
      Task capacity needs: 4
      For this example, program should return false.
      Got some idea that this needs to be solved using dynamic programming concept, but could not figure out exact solution.

      61. Hash each row, and count its frequency
      Given a binary matrix of N X N of integers , you need to return only unique rows of binary arrays
      eg:

      1 0 1 1 0
      0 1 0 0 1
      1 1 1 0 0
      ans:
      0 1 0 0 1
      1 0 1 1 0
      1 1 1 0 0

      63. Give a min and max of an integer array, write a function to randomly return a number inside of this range, but not in the list. Also write a class that contains this function.
      If the blacklist is short, just make a hashset of this blacklist. Generate a random number between min and max, and check if it is in the blacklist. 
      If the blacklist is long, above solution will get rejected many times. We can pre-generate a whitelist, that only contains the accepted integers. When sampling, sample the index in whitelist. However, this solution requires pre-process, 

      64. Give a N*N matrix, print it out diagonally.
      Follow up, if it is a M*N matrix, how to print it out.
      Example:
      1 2 3

      7 8 9
      print:
      1
      2 4
      3 5 7
      6 8
      9

      65. Given an array of integers, sort the array into a wave like array, namely

      Swap A[i] with A[i+1] for those A[i] violating above rules.

      Write a method to determine if two strings are anagrams of each other.
      e.g. isAnagram(“secure”, “rescue”) → false
      e.g. isAnagram(“conifers”, “fir cones”) → true
      e.g. isAnagram(“google”, “facebook”) → false

      66. Given an array A[], find (i, j) such that A[i] < A[j] and (j - i) is maximum.
      Solu: Maintain minL and maxR array, for I, minL[i] = index of smallest element between 0 to I, and maxR[i] = index of largest element between I to A.length-1. Since each pair A[i] < A[j] and i<j should have a middle k that A[i] <= A[k] <= A[j] and i<=k<=j. We can iterate the minL and maxR, to find the maximum (max[R] – min[L])

      67. Flatten a List<List<Integer>> in Java and implement the hasNext() and next() methods.
      e.g. [[6,8],4] should return true when at 6, 8 and false at 4

      68. Given N dices.Each dice has A faces.That means each dice has numbers from 1 to A.Given Sum S,Find the number of ways to make the sum S if dices are rolled together

      69. You visited a list of places recently, but you do not remember the order in which you visited them. You have with you the airplane tickets that you used for travelling. Each ticket contains just the start location and the end location. Can you reconstruct your journey?
      Can be reconstructed if there is a unique source, using topological sort

      70. Rearrange an array using swap with 0.
      You have two arrays src, tgt, containing two permutations of the numbers 0..n-1. You would like to rearrange src so that it equals tgt. The only allowed operations is “swap a number with 0”, e.g. {1,0,2,3} -> {1,3,2,0} (“swap 3 with 0”). Write a program that prints to stdout the list of required operations.
      Practical application:
      Imagine you have a parking place with n slots and n-1 cars numbered from 1..n-1. The free slot is represented by 0 in the problem. If you want to rearrange the cars, you can only move one car at a time into the empty slot, which is equivalent to “swap a number with 0”.
      Example:
      src={1,0,2,3}; tgt={0,2,3,1};

      71. How do you find the greatest 1000 elements in a list of a million elements? No other information given. What would be the runtime? Hint: You can do better than O(n log n). I didn't realize but it could be possible with Tree or Heaps.

      73. Q: Design a component that will implement web browser history. the user goes to different site and once he press on history button you should display the last 5 (no duplicates allowed, and 5 can be any N later) if duplicates occur display the most recent one. so if user visit : G,A,B,C,A,Y and than press "history" we will display Y,A,C,B,G. and of course he can go later to two other websites and than press "history" we will show them than the previous 3.
      LRU cache with size N

      74. Given a server that has requests coming in. Design a data structure such that you can fetch the count of the number requests in the last second, minute and hour.
      Solu: I think a circular buffer will work here. If the accuracy at 1s is acceptable, we can maintain a 3600 sized circular array, with three pointer, now, lastMinEnd, lastHourEnd. We also maintain three two counter, lastMinCount, lastHourCount. Whenever, a request comes in, we update the A[now], also lastMinCount, lastHourCount. Whenever, 1second passes, move lastMinEnd and lastHourEnd forward, and update their count. Since this is a circular buffer, pay attention to the boundary condition. 
      Although a dqueue also works, it need to store each request, therefore not as spatial efficient as above solution. 

      75. A log of wood has n marks on it. Cost of cutting wood at a particular mark is proportional to the length of the log. The log of wood can be cut at all the marks. Find the optimal order of the marks where the log should be cut in order to minimize the total cost of cutting.

      A river separates two banks, there are 3 men and 3 lions on one side that need to be taken across using a boat that can carry 2 entities at a time(irrespective of being a lion and man), subject to the condition that at no point can you have more number of lions than men on any bank, as then the lions would eat the man/men. Solve the puzzle. Then code it to make it a generic program that solves the puzzle for X men and Y lions.

      81. Given a dictionary, and a list of letters ( or consider as a string), find the longest word that only uses letters from the string. [I didn't meet this question, what's the best solution?]

      82. Count the number of positive integers less than N that does not contains digit 4.
      Solu: In order to avoid 4, a digit a_d >= 4, it only has a_d choice, if it is smaller than 4, it has a_d+1 choice. Then multiply all digits

Suppose we put N keys into this M-slotted hash table, what is the probability that there will be a slot with i elements? i could vary from 0 to N.


      84. Given an 8x8 chess board, you have a bishop that moves from the current to the target position. write a code to find the minimum path from the current to the target position.
      If source’s color != target’s color, it cannot reach 
      Else if they are on one diagonal, return 1
      Else return 2

      85. Given 2 arrays A,B, where x(A.length) < y(B.length), we want to insert (y - x) 0's to A at various places such that A*B is minimum. For instance, if A = (1, -1) and B = (1,2, 3, 4), then inserting two 0's in the middle of A such that A = (1, 0, 0, -1) would minimize A*B. I think he was looking for a dynamic problem solution.

      89. A rooted binary tree with keys in its nodes has the binary search tree property (BST property) if, for every node, the keys in its left subtree are smaller than its own key, and the keys in its right subtree are larger than its own key. It has the heap property if, for every node, the keys of its children are all smaller than its own key. You are given a set of n binary tree nodes that each contain an integer i and an integer j. No two i values are equal and no two j values are equal. We must assemble the nodes into a single binary tree where the i values obey the BST property and the j values obey the heap property. If you pay attention only to the second key in each node, the tree looks like a heap, and if you pay attention only to the first key in each node, it looks like a binary search tree.Describe a recursive algorithm for assembling such a tree

      90. Given two unsorted int arrays, find the kth element in the merged, sorted array.
      example:
      int[] a= [3 1 7]
      int[] b = [4 9]
      k: 3
      return 4.
      Solu: maxHeap of size k, compare each newly element with top of heap, replace it if has a smaller one. Finally, the top of maxHeap is the result. But select kth smallest from one array only needs O(n) time. 

      Anagram solver. An anagram is two words that contains the same letters 
      the same amount of times. For example, angle and angel are anagrams. Given a
      dictionary, perform some preprocessing for a anagram solver. The anagram 
      solver takes a string as input and prints out a list of all anagrams 
      contained in the dictionary.

       Meeting place. You have a city with streets running parallel both 
       horizonally and vetically creating a giant grid. The dimension of each grid 
       is 1 X 1. All street corners in the city can be represented by a coordinate 
       (int x, int y). Given an array of people represented by their closest street
       corner, calculate a street corner to meet where their combined traveling 
       distance is the shortest. Assume everyone can only travel on road. For 
       example, the traveling distance from [1,1] to [2,2] is 2.

       100. You are given an array A of k values which contain int values in sorted (asec) order. Find top k values (asec) which can either be the number from the array A, or sum of any two numbers from A or sum of any three numbers from A. So, if A's values are represented as : a1,a2,...,ak , the possible numbers can be: a(i), a(i)+a(j), a(i)+a(j)+a(l) for any i,j,l < k
       Ex: A[7] = {3,4,5,15,19,20,25}
       output B[7] = {3,4,5,(3+4),(3+5),(4+5),(3+4+5)}

       Why Java has class-level private methods, i.e. Person p1 can access Person p2’s private method
       The private modifier enforces Encapsulation principle.
       The idea is that 'outer world' should not make changes to Person internal processes because Person implementation may change over time (and you would have to change the whole outer world to fix the differences in implementation - which is nearly to impossible).
       When instance of Person accesses internals of other Person instance - you can be sure that both instances always know the details of implementation of Person. If the logic of internal to Person processes is changed - all you have to do is change the code of Person.


       101. Suppose we are given an array A[1 .. n] with the special property that A[1] ≥ A[2] and
       A[n − 1] ≤ A[n]. We say that an element A[x] is a local minimum if it is less than or equal
       to both its neighbors, or more formally, if A[x − 1] ≥ A[x] and A[x] ≤ A[x + 1]. For example,
       there are ﬁve local minima in the following array:
       9 7 7 2 1 3 7 5 4 7 3 3 4 8 6 9
       We can obviously ﬁnd a local minimum in O(n) time by scanning through the array. Describe

       121. You are given a String number containing the digits of a
       phone number (the number of digits, n, can be any positive integer) . To help you memorize
       the number, you want to divide it into groups of contiguous digits. Each group must contain
       exactly 2 or 3 digits. There are three kinds of groups:
       • Excellent: A group that contains only the same digits. For example, 000 or 77.
       • Good: A group of 3 digits, 2 of which are the same. For example, 030, 229 or 166.
       • Usual: A group in which all the digits are distinct. For example, 123 or 90.
       The quality of a group assignment is defined as
       2 × (number of excellent groups) + (number of good groups)
       Divide the number into groups such that the quality is maximized. Design an efficient

       add(p)--adds the value p to the set
       delete(p)--removes the value p from the set
       getrandom()--returns a random value from the set (all items should be equally likely). (Assume you have access to some nice random() function.)
       Need not write actual code, just sketch a structure to implement this efficiently.

So if input (1,6) (2,3) (4,11), (1,6) should be returned. Some suggest to use Interval Tree to get this done in O(logn), but I did not understand how to construct and use the Interval Tree after reading its wiki page. Is there any other way to do it? If Interval tree is the only option, please educate me how to construct/use one. Thanks.
